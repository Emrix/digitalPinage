# digitalPinage

digitalPinage is a play on words for Digital Signage and Raspberry Pi.

The purpose of this project is to create a program which will use the Raspberry Pi Zero only for Digital Signage on a single TV.  This project was inspired by Stone Gate Center for the Arts, LLC (http://www.stonegateweddings.com).  They needed a way to dynamically play and show content on a movable TV without using USB or DVD's of any sort.  This just turned out to be one of the simplest solutions.

This project should work on any computer that has Node.js installed.

To install:
